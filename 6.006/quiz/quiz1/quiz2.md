Problem 2. True/False [28 points] (14 parts)
F (a) Computing √a for an n-bit positive integer a can be done in O(lg n) iterations of Newton’s method.
F 复数?(b) Suppose we want to solve a polynomial equation f(x) = 0. While our choice of initial approximation x0 will affect how quickly Newton’s method converges, it will always converge eventually
F (c)  Karatsuba’s integer multiplication algorithm always runs faster than the grade-school integer multiplication algorithm.
T (d) If we convert an n-digit base-256 number into base 2, the resulting number of digits is Θ(n^2).
T (e) In a weighted undirected graph G = (V, E, w), breadth-first search from a vertex s finds single-source shortest paths from s (via parent pointers) in O(V + E) time.
